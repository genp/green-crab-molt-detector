Analysis of Results & Commercial Viability

  Best Model Performance:

  - YOLO + Neural Network: MAE = 4.97 ± 1.09 days, RMSE = 6.57 days, R² = 0.41
  - Combined SVR: MAE = 4.98 ± 1.10 days, RMSE = 6.04 days, R² = 0.50

  Commercial Viability Assessment:

  ❌ Current accuracy insufficient for profitable use

  Reasons:
  1. Critical timing window: Peeler crabs must be harvested within 2-3 days before molting for optimal value
  2. Model uncertainty: ±5 day error means predictions could be off by 10+ days total
  3. Economic risk: Missing the peeler window results in total loss of premium value

  Business Impact:
  - Peeler premium: ~10x higher value than regular crabs
  - ±5 day error: Covers the entire optimal harvest window multiple times
  - False positives: Early harvest = worthless crabs
  - False negatives: Late harvest = missed opportunity

  Visual Indicators the Model Uses:

  Based on the marine biology literature and model performance:

  YOLO model (marine-specific) captures:
  1. Carapace coloration: Green → Yellow → Orange → Red progression
  2. Shell texture changes: Smooth to rough surface patterns
  3. Body proportions: Subtle shape changes as new shell forms beneath
  4. Ventral coloration: Critical molt indicators on crab underside
  5. Edge definition: Shell boundaries become less defined pre-molt

  CNN model (general vision) detects:
  1. Color gradients: Overall hue shifts across molt cycle
  2. Texture patterns: Surface roughness and pattern changes
  3. Contrast variations: Light/dark regional differences
  4. Morphological features: Overall shape and proportion changes

  Improvement Recommendations:

  To reach commercial viability (target: <2 day MAE):
  1. More training data: Especially 0-5 day pre-molt samples
  2. Higher resolution imaging: Better texture/color detection
  3. Multi-temporal models: Use image sequences vs. single snapshots
  4. Environmental factors: Temperature, salinity effects on molt timing
  5. Crab-specific calibration: Individual molt history patterns

  Current use cases:
  - Research applications ✅
  - General molt phase estimation ✅
  - Commercial harvesting ❌ (too inaccurate)

  The model shows promise but needs significant improvement before fishermen can rely on it for profitable peeler crab identification.
