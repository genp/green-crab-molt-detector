# Green Crab Molt Detection App - Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Image Upload Bug
**Problem**: When uploading an image via drag-and-drop or file picker, clicking "Analyze Molt Phase" showed error "Please select an image first"

**Root Cause**: The JavaScript code was checking `fileInput.files[0]` which wasn't populated when using drag-and-drop

**Solution**: 
- Added global `selectedFile` variable to store the uploaded file
- Modified `handleFile()` to store file in `selectedFile`
- Modified `predictMoltPhase()` to use `selectedFile` instead of `fileInput.files[0]`
- Modified `resetUpload()` to clear `selectedFile`

**Files Changed**: `templates/index.html`

### 2. StandardScaler Not Fitted Error
**Problem**: Prediction failed with "This StandardScaler instance is not fitted yet"

**Root Cause**: Model files were saved without their corresponding scalers, causing the app to create unfitted StandardScaler instances

**Solution**:
- Created `fix_models.py` script to combine models with their scalers
- Converted old model format to new dictionary format containing both model and scaler
- Created properly named model files expected by the app

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `fix_models.py` (new)
- `models/molt_regressor_yolo_random_forest.joblib` (created)
- `models/molt_regressor_cnn_random_forest.joblib` (created)
- `models/molt_regressor_vit_random_forest.joblib` (created)

### 3. Missing Model Files
**Problem**: App warned about missing temporal model files at startup

**Solution**: Copied temporal models to expected locations:
- `models/best_temporal_model.pkl`
- `models/random_forest_model.joblib`
- `models/gradient_boosting_model.joblib`

## Tests Added

### `test_app.py`
Comprehensive test suite including:
- File extension validation
- Molt phase categorization
- API endpoints (health, predict)
- Error handling
- File cleanup
- Integration tests

### `test_with_real_image.py`
Tests the app with actual crab images from the dataset

### `test_multiple_images.py`
Tests multiple images from different molt stages

### `verify_fix.py`
Verification script that checks:
- Models have properly fitted scalers
- App starts without errors
- Image upload fix is applied

## How to Use the Fixed App

1. **Start the app**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Open in browser**:
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5001`

3. **Upload an image**:
   - Click "Choose File" or drag-and-drop a crab image
   - Click "Analyze Molt Phase"

4. **View results**:
   - Days until molt (negative = post-molt)
   - Molt phase category
   - Harvest recommendation
   - Confidence level

## Verification

Run the verification script to ensure all fixes are applied:
```bash
python verify_fix.py
```

Run tests to verify functionality:
```bash
python test_app.py
```

## Model Performance

The app successfully:
- Loads CNN feature extractor (ResNet50)
- Uses Random Forest regressor with fitted StandardScaler
- Predicts molt phase from crab images
- Provides harvest recommendations for sustainable fishing
